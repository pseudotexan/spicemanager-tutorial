Welcome to Spicewrapper's documentation!
===================================

**Spicewrapper** is a python library containing a variety of convenience functions for NGSpice.  These include:

- Optimization: specify which netlist parameters you want to vary to achieve a given outcome from the simulation.
   - Randomized grid search: Iterate over the shuffled set of parameter combinations, and find the best one.
   - Basinhopping: Use python's basinhopping optimizer to combine a stochastic search with gradient optimization.
   - Outcomes: specify an objective function for the simulation based on any measurable quantity from it. For example: the current through inductor L1, the total energy dissipated by DC sources, the voltage at node 3, etc.
   - 



**Lumache** (/lu'make/) is a Python library for cooks and food lovers
that creates recipes mixing random ingredients.
It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
